Relational Databases
MySQL: An open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) based on SQL (Structured Query Language).
Post greSQL: An advanced open-source relational database known for its robustness, reliability, and feature completeness.
SQLite: A lightweight, serverless, self-contained SQL database engine that requires minimal setup and administration.
Oracle Database: A commercial relational database management system developed by Oracle Corporation, widely used in enterprise applications.
Microsoft SQL Server: A relational database management system developed by Microsoft, primarily targeted for enterprise environments.

NoSQL Databases
MongoDB: A cross-platform document-oriented NoSQL database program, using JSON-like documents with schema.
Cassandra: A distributed NoSQL database management system designed to handle large amounts of data across many commodity servers.
Redis: An in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache, and message broker, supporting various data structures such as strings, hashes, lists, sets, and more.
Couchbase: A distributed NoSQL document-oriented database that is optimized for interactive applications.
Amazon DynamoDB: A fully managed proprietary NoSQL database service provided by Amazon Web Services (AWS), designed for scalability and performance.

Key-Value Stores
Redis: Although Redis can be used as a NoSQL database, it is commonly known for its key-value store capabilities due to its in-memory nature and support for various data structures.
Amazon DynamoDB: While DynamoDB is a NoSQL database, it can also function as a key-value store due to its simple primary key structure.

Document Stores
MongoDB: MongoDB is primarily a document-oriented database, storing data in flexible, JSON-like documents.
Couchbase: Couchbase also falls into this category as it stores data in JSON format and provides document-oriented features.

Column-Family Stores
Cassandra: Cassandra is a prominent example of a column-family store, where data is organized by columns rather than rows, providing flexibility in schema design and scalability.

Graph Databases
Neo4j: A graph database management system known for its native graph storage and processing, optimized for handling connected data.
Amazon Neptune: A fully managed graph database service provided by AWS, compatible with both property graph and RDF graph models.

Time-Series Databases
InfluxDB: An open-source time series database designed to handle high write and query loads.
Prometheus: A systems monitoring and alerting toolkit with built-in time series database capabilities, widely used in cloud-native environments.
